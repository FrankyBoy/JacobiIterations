# JacobiIterations
Some C stuff heat-distribution calculations using jacobi-iteration which I did back in my Uni days. Will add more if I have the time to get them working and figure out what the differences are.

## NeatUI
A very OOP-esque implementation with structs containing function pointers and stuff. Has a console-UI.  
Why this console-ui is not using any library? Because the requirement was to do output without a lib.
